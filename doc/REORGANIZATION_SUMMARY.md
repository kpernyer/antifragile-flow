# Python Directory Reorganization Summary

## ✅ Reorganization Complete

The top-level `python/` directory has been cleaned up and its contents moved to appropriate locations following your preferred organizational structure.

## 📁 New Directory Structure

### **test/** - Test and Demo Scripts
- `test/test_globex_training.py` - LoRA model training test script
- `test/test_trained_model_inference.py` - Direct model inference testing
- `test/demo_model_comparison.py` - Base vs trained model comparison demo

### **model/trained/** - Trained LoRA Models
- `model/trained/train_globex-industrial_4568ba49/` - Complete Globex trained model
  - `adapter_model.safetensors` (119MB) - Main LoRA adapter weights
  - `adapter_config.json` - LoRA configuration
  - `tokenizer.json`, `vocab.json`, `merges.txt` - Tokenizer files
  - `checkpoint-1/`, `checkpoint-2/` - Training checkpoints
  - All other training artifacts

## 🔄 What Was Moved

| Original Location | New Location | Description |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `python/test_globex_training.py` | `test/test_globex_training.py` | Training test script |
| `python/test_trained_model_inference.py` | `test/test_trained_model_inference.py` | Inference test (updated paths) |
| `python/demo_model_comparison.py` | `test/demo_model_comparison.py` | Comparison demo |
| `python/models/train_globex-industrial_4568ba49/` | `model/trained/train_globex-industrial_4568ba49/` | Complete trained model |

## 🛠️ Updated File References

### **test/test_trained_model_inference.py**
- Updated model path from `/python/models/` to `/model/trained/`
- Path now: `/Users/kenper/src/kolomolo-hackathon/model/trained/train_globex-industrial_4568ba49`

### **test/test_globex_training.py**
- Updated import paths to work from `test/` directory
- Service imports: `sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))`

## 🗑️ Cleanup

The top-level `python/` directory has been removed as it's now empty. All Python test scripts are now properly organized in the `test/` folder, and all trained models are in the `model/trained/` folder.

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✅ **Clean Top Level** - No more cluttered `python/` directory at root
- ✅ **Logical Organization** - Tests in `test/`, models in `model/`
- ✅ **Consistent Structure** - Follows your preference for singular directory names
- ✅ **Preserved Functionality** - All scripts updated with correct paths
- ✅ **Maintained Assets** - 119MB Globex LoRA model safely moved

The repository is now ready for git commit with the clean, organized structure! 🚀
