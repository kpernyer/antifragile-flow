Complete Workflow Integration Test

This demonstrates the full integration from Temporal workflows to model training,
showing how all components work together in the proper architecture.

Flow:
1. Document Processing Workflow (Temporal)
2. Model Training Activity (Business Interface)
3. Training Service (Technical Implementation)
4. Real ML Training (LoRA Fine-tuning)
