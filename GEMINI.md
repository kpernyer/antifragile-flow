# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an **Organizational Twin System** - an intelligent human-AI collaborative platform that creates digital twins of organizations, enabling sophisticated decision-making through AI agents, human-in-the-loop workflows, and adaptive communication patterns built on Temporal orchestration.

## Core Architecture

### Organizational Twin Intelligence

The heart of the system is the **Organizational Twin** - an AI system that builds comprehensive understanding of your organization:

- **üß† Behavioral Modeling**: Learns individual and team decision-making patterns
- **üó£Ô∏è Communication Intelligence**: Adapts to personal and cultural communication styles
- **üìã Process Optimization**: Continuously improves workflow efficiency based on outcomes
- **üîó Relationship Mapping**: Understands organizational structure and stakeholder relationships

### AI Agent System

Intelligent agent architecture where AI agents understand organizational roles and can seamlessly collaborate with or substitute for human team members:

- **Strategic Decision Agents**: Handle high-level planning and strategic choices
- **Communication Agents**: Manage personalized messaging and stakeholder engagement
- **Document Processing Agents**: Analyze, summarize, and extract insights from documents
- **Consensus Building Agents**: Facilitate agreement across diverse stakeholders
- **Cultural Intelligence Agents**: Adapt communication style to organizational culture

### Temporal Workflow Components

Each implementation follows sophisticated Temporal patterns optimized for human-AI collaboration:

- **Workflows** (`workflows.py/ts`) - Orchestrate complex decision-making processes with human-in-the-loop
- **Activities** (`activities.py/ts`) - Handle AI processing, external service calls, and document operations
- **Worker** (`worker.py/ts`) - Long-running processes that execute workflows and activities
- **Starter** (`starter.py/ts`) - Clients that trigger workflow execution with organizational context

### Storage Architecture

- **PostgreSQL**: Structured organizational data, user profiles, decision history
- **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph for relationships, organizational intelligence, and pattern recognition
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible document storage for media files and large data objects
- **Redis**: Caching and session management

### Key Files and Components

- **Organizational Twin** (`organizational_twin.py`) - Core intelligence system
- **Prompt System** (`shared/prompts/`) - AI prompt templates with Jinja2 templating
- **Base Models** (`shared/models/`) - Strongly-typed Pydantic data models
- **Configuration** (`shared/config/`) - Environment and service configuration
- **Docker Compose** (`compose.yaml`) - Complete infrastructure stack

## Temporal Best Practices for Organizational Intelligence

Following these patterns ensures your organizational workflows are:
- **Deterministic workflows** - Can replay without side effects
- **Fault tolerant** - Automatic retries and recovery from failures
- **Observable** - Complete visibility into decision-making processes
- **Scalable** - Add more workers and agents as needed
- **Maintainable** - Clear separation between orchestration and business logic

### 1. Workflow as Intelligent Orchestrator
- Workflow orchestrates human-AI collaboration patterns
- Manages decision escalation and consensus building
- Handles timeout and backup scenarios for absent humans
- Tracks organizational context and learning

### 2. Activities Handle Specialized Operations
- AI agent interactions and prompt processing
- Document analysis and storage operations
- External service integrations (email, calendar, etc.)
- Database operations and knowledge graph updates
- Human interaction management

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Patterns
- **Collaborative Decision Making**: Humans provide strategic input while AI handles analysis
- **Intelligent Escalation**: AI manages routine decisions but escalates complex issues
- **Backup and Coverage**: AI agents step in when humans are unavailable
- **Continuous Learning**: System learns from human decisions to improve recommendations

### 4. Proper Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Strong typing with Pydantic models for Python
- Comprehensive interfaces for TypeScript
- Organizational context embedded in all data structures
- Serializable models compatible with Temporal

### 5. AI-Assisted Communication Patterns
- Personality-aware message generation using prompt templates
- Cultural intelligence for organizational communication
- Context-aware escalation and routing
- Adaptive messaging based on recipient preferences

## Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies: `make install`
2. Start infrastructure: `make docker-up` (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MinIO, Temporal)
3. Validate prompts: `make prompts-validate`

- **Prefer editing existing files** over creating new ones
- Follow established patterns for human-AI collaboration
- Use organizational context in all decision-making logic

- Ensure all AI interactions use validated prompt templates

### Development Priorities
1. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Focus on seamless integration patterns
2. **Organizational Intelligence**: Build systems that learn and adapt
3. **Communication Excellence**: Ensure culturally-aware messaging
